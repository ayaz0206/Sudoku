This project is to build an engine to play the Sudoku game.

The rules of the game are simple enough. There is a 9 by 9 grid divided into 9 boxes.

The goal of the game is to fill out the entire grid with numbers. The trick is that every row, column, and box must have all nine digits (1 to 9). That is, if row 1 for example already has digits 8 and 9, they cannot be used in the the same row anymore.
